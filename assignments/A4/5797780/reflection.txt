2.10:   Missing.

        Score: 0/10.

2.2.4:  Fully implemented, also with a few tests, but not very thorough.
        Incorrect in some cases according to feedback.

        Score: 12/15.

2.11.2: Generic read implemented with extensive test suite, although no sensible
        class names. These are irrelevant for the shape of the data.

        Score: 25/25.

2.2.6:  Implemented, but merge still runs indefinitely. According to the
        feedback it is possible to have an associative merge, but their proposed
        merge is not symmetric -- it delays the right hand side. Implemented
        functions are tested properly.

        Score: 20/25.

2.6.1:  Index contract implemented with test suite that also tests failure.
        Preserves works correctly according to tests. Good example of allPos vs
        allPos' is given.

        Score: 25/25.

Final:  82/100.
